# The-Financial-Dilemma
This is an educational game I made back in my senior year of high school as part of the Graduation with Distinction in STEM Program.

The story follows an ordinary high schooler who learns about the importance of financial literacy skills. In order to
make it to the end, the player must make the best choices possible to ensure the protagonist, Jessica, manages her
money while also having a good social life.

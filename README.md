# The-Financial-Dilemma
This is an educational game I made back in my senior year of high school as part of the Graduation with Distinction in STEM Program.

The story follows an ordinary high schooler who learns about the importance of financial literacy skills. In order to
make it to the end, the player must make the best choices possible to ensure the protagonist, Jessica, manages her
money while also having a good social life.

This game was created in a visual novel engine known as Renpy.

While the art, story, and game script were done by me, the music was not. All music present in this game is royalty free and by Kevin MacLeod.

In addition, a lot of the game's files were created upon making a new project in Renpy. The main files I actually worked on were script.rpy (for the game script)
and options.rpy (to edit a few of the default options)
